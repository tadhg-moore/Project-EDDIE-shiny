q1,"Q1. How have you used forecasts (ecological, political, sports, any kind!) before in your day-to-day life?"
q2,Q2. How can ecological forecasts improve both natural resource management and ecological understanding?
q3,Q3. How do you think forecasts of freshwater primary productivity will differ between warmer lakes and colder lakes?
q4,Q4. Choose one of the ecological forecasts above and use the website to answer the questions below.
q4a,a. What ecological variable(s) are being forecasted?
q4b,b. What type of ecosystem are the variables part of?
q4c,c. Why does this forecast exist?
q4d,d. Describe the way(s) in which the forecast is visualized
q5,Q5. Fill out information about the selected NEON site:
q5a,a. Name of selected site:
q5b,b. Four letter site identifier:
q5c,c. Latitude:
q5d,d. Longitude:
q5e,e. Lake Area (km2):
q5f,f. Elevation (m):
q6,Q6. Fill out the table below with the description of site variables:
q6a,Air temperature
q6b,Water temperature profile
q6c,Nitrate sensor
q6d,Underwater PAR
q6e,Chlorophyll-a
q7,Q7. Describe the effect of each of the following variables on chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a is used as a proxy measurement for phytoplankton concentration in aquatic environments.
q7a,Air temperature
q7b,Water temperature profile
q7c,Nitrate sensor
q7d,Underwater PAR
q8,"Q8. Were there any other relationships you found at your site? If so, please describe below."
q9,Q9. Select how you envision each driving variable to affect productivity.
q9a,Water temperature profile
q9b,Incoming light
q9c,Available nutrients
q10,Q10. Classify the following as either a state variable or a parameter by dragging it into the corresponding bin.
q11,Q11. We are using chlorophyll-a as a proxy measurement for phytoplankton concentration which is a measure of aquatic primary productivity. Select how you envision each parameter to affect chlorophyll-a concentrations:
q11a,Grazing of phytoplankton
q11b,Zooplankton mortality
q11c,Nutrient uptake by phytoplankton
q12,"Q12. Using the default model, simulate the baseline model scenario. Describe the pattern of chlorophyll-a concentration throughout the year?"
q13,"Q13. Change the parameters to simulate the following scenarios, and describe the chlorophyll-a responses for:"
q13a,"a. Medium grazing, medium mortality and high uptake (Save parameters)"
q13b,"b. High grazing, high mortality and low uptake  (Save parameters)"
q14,"Q14. Develop a scenario (e.g. the model is sensitive to light, mortality = 0.7, etc.) and hypothesize how you think chlorophyll-a concentrations will respond prior to running the simulation.  (Save parameters)"
q14a,a. Write your hypothesis of how chlorophyll-a will respond to your scenario here:
q14b,b. Run your model scenario. Was your hypothesis supported or refuted? Describe what you observed:
q15,"Q15. Add the observations to the plot. Calibrate your model by selecting sensitive variables and adjusting the parameters until they best fit the observed data. Save your parameters, these are what will be used for the forecast."
