EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
Macro,"Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and ecological forecasting, supported by the NSF Macrosystems Biology program grant 1926050."
macro_EF,"We have developed the following four modules within the Macrosystems EDDIE framework to teach undergraduates to produce, interpret, and communicate ecological forecasts"
eco_forecast,"Ecological forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding and predicting changes in populations, communities, and ecosystems. Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for changes in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasters develop and update forecasts using the iterative forecasting cycle, in which they make a hypothesis of how an ecological system works; embed their hypothesis in a model; and use the model to make a forecast of future conditions. When observations become available, they can assess the accuracy of their forecast, which indicates if their hypothesis is supported or needs to be updated before the next forecast is generated."
theme_mod8,"The theme of this module is understanding how forecasts are connected to decision-making. Ecological forecasts have vast potential for aiding decision-making for range of different users, yet forecast results may be challenging to understand because they inherently are associated with uncertainty in alternate future outcomes which have not yet occurred. This module will teach students different ways to visualize forecasts; how uncertainty in forecast visualizations can influence decision-making; and to create their own visualizations of probabilistic ecological forecasts tailored to a specific user.  "
LO1,Describe what ecological forecasts are and how they are used (Activity A)
LO2,"Identify the components of a structured decision (Activity A, B, C)"
LO3,"Discuss how forecast uncertainty relates to decision-making (Activity A, B, C)"
LO4,"Understand how stakeholder needs affect forecasting decision support (Activity B, C)"
LO5,"Identify different ways to represent uncertainty in a visualization (Activity A, B, C)"
LO6,Create visualizations tailored to specific stakeholders (Activity C)
privacy_policy,This Shiny App does not collect or store your any of your data.
to_address_question,"To address this question, we will examine how uncertainty is visualized in ecological forecasts and how forecasts are used to make decisions. We will identify different ways in which ecological forecasts are currently visualized. We will also use a water quality forecasting system to make decisions about managing a drinking water reservoir, and examine how uncertainty in forecast output can influence decision-making. Lastly, we will explore  different ways of visualizing forecast output and how they can be tailored for different users of the forecast."
workflow1,"After the instructor completes the PowerPoint presentation, students will launch the Shiny app. Students work individually or in pairs to navigate through the upper tabs (e.g., ""Activity A"", ""Activity B"", and ""Activity C"")  to complete each of the objectives embedded within each tab. Within each activity tab, there are individual objectives which must be completed before moving onto the next one."
workflow2,There are questions in green text boxes embedded throughout the Shiny app which students can input answers into.
workflow3,"When all of the objectives are completed and questions are answered, navigate to the ""Generate Report"" section in the ""Introduction"" tab. This will then create a Microsoft Word document with all of the forecasts and answers embedded within, which can be downloaded and finalized before submitting to the instructor."
workflow4,"You can save your progress by downloading the user input before you leave the page (see ""Save your progress"" on this webpage for instructions on how to do this). This will allow you to return to this Shiny app and start from where you left off."
workflow5,"You can check your progress throughout the app by navigating to ""Questions still to be completed"" within the ""Generate Report"" section in the ""Module Workflow"" tab. This will tell you if there are any questions which you have not yet answered."

activityB_scenario1,"You and your partner are drinking water managers for the primary drinking water source reservoir for your city, which has ~300,000 residents. In 14 days, a major international swimming competition with an estimated ~2,000 participants will be swimming 3.8 miles within the reservoir. It is expected that this event and its spectators will bring >$10 million dollars of valuable tourism revenue to your city. However, the water utility is concerned about the reservoir's water quality at this time of year, as historically there have been major algal blooms, which typically require expensive water treatment techniques. Without treatment, algal blooms can pose potential health issues to aquatic life, swimmers, and the city's drinking water. During the swimming competition, the water utility must continue to use the reservoir as a drinking water source, and so must balance the needs of maintaining optimal water quality for local residents, aquatic health of the reservoir, as well as ensuring the safety of the swimmers."
activityB_scenario2,"Luckily, the reservoir was recently outfitted with a state-of-the-art water quality ensemble forecasting system. Every morning, managers receive a 14-day forecast of future algal concentrations in the reservoir, which are updated daily with the actual algal concentrations, measured in real-time using sensors in the water. The forecast is ensemble-based meaning it produces 25 different forecasts of algal concentrations. Following local and national guidelines for beach closure, algal levels above 25 ug/L can be harmful for drinking without water treatment and detrimental to aquatic life, and levels above 35 ug/L are not suitable for human swimming."
activityB_scenario3,"As drinking water managers of the reservoir, you and your partner must decide how to manage the water quality in the reservoir every day over a 14-day period, using the forecasts as a guide."
