EDDIE,"Project EDDIE (Environmental Data-Driven Inquiry and Exploration) is a suite of education projects composed of STEM disciplinary and educational researchers. We develop flexible classroom teaching modules using large, publicly available datasets to engage students in STEM and improve their quantitative reasoning. Teaching modules span topics such as ecology, limnology, geology, hydrology, and environmental sciences. EDDIE also helps build the associated professional development needed to ensure effective use of the teaching modules."
Macro,Macrosystems ecology is the study of ecological dynamics at multiple interacting spatial and temporal scales. Our interdisciplinary team is developing flexible classroom modules that introduce undergraduate students to the core concepts of macrosystems ecology and simulation modeling through the lens of limnology.
eco_forecast,"Forecasting is a tool that can be used for understanding changes in macrosystems ecology. To anticipate and prepare for increased variability in populations, communities, and ecosystems, there is a pressing need to know the future state of ecological systems across space and time (Dietze et al., 2018). Ecological forecasting is an emerging approach which provides an estimate of the future state of an ecological system with uncertainty, allowing society to prepare for fluctuations in important ecosystem services. Ecological forecasts are a powerful test of the scientific method because ecologists make hypotheses of how ecological systems work; embed their hypotheses in models; use the model to make a forecast of future conditions; and then when observations are available, see how their forecast performed, which indicates if their hypotheses are supported. Consequently, macrosystems ecologists are increasingly using ecological forecasts to predict how ecosystems are changing over space and time. However, forecasts must be effectively designed and communicated to those who need them to make decisions in order to realize their potential for protecting natural resources."
theme_mod8,"The theme of this module is understanding how forecasts are connected to decision-making of stakeholders, or those who use forecasts to aid in decision-making. Ecological forecasts have vast potential for aiding decision-making for range of different stakeholders, yet forecast results may be challenging to understand because they inherently are associated with uncertainty in alternate future outcomes which have not yet occurred. This module will teach students the basic components of an ecological forecast; the importance of connecting forecast visualizations to stakeholder needs for aiding decision-making; and to create their own visualizations of probabilistic forecasts of ecological variables for a specific stakeholder.  "
LO1,Describe what ecological forecasts are and how they are used (Activity A)
LO2,"Identify the components of a structured decision (Activity A, B, C)"
LO3,Examine how an ecological forecast may affect decision-making (Activity B)
LO4,"Understand how stakeholder needs affect forecasting decision support (Activity B, C)"
LO5,"Discuss factors which influence uncertainty in forecast output and how forecast uncertainty relates to decision-making (Activity A, B, C)"
LO6,Create visualizations tailored to specific stakeholders (Activity C)
to_address_question,"To address this question, we will examine existing ecological forecasts to explore how decisions are made and how visualizations can be tailored to different stakeholders. We will be identifying the diversity of ecological variables currently being forecasted, as well as the different types of stakeholders and needs for making decisions with current ecological forecasts. We will also use output from a real water quality forecasting system to examine how uncertainty in forecast output changes over time, and how this can impact decision-making into the future. Lastly, we will explore how different ways of visualizing forecast output can be useful for different types of stakeholders of the forecast."

activityB_scenario1,"Scenario: You and your partner are drinking water managers for Carvins Cove Reservoir, which is the primary drinking water source for Roanoke, Virginia, a city with nearly one million residents. In 16 days, a major international swimming competition with an estimated ~2,000 participants will be swimming 3.8 miles within the reservoir. It is expected that this event and its spectators will bring >$13 million dollars of valuable tourism revenue to Roanoke. However, the water utility is concerned about the reservoir's water quality this time of year, as historically there have been major algal blooms, an ecological event which typically requires expensive treatment techniques. These treatments can either happen in the reservoir (but potentially harm aquatic life such as plants, macroinvertebrates, fish, etc.) or in the treatment plant. Without treatment, algal blooms can pose potential health issues to aquatic life, swimmers, and the city’s drinking water. During the swimming competition, the water utility must continue to use the reservoir as a drinking water source to the city, and so must balance the needs of maintaining optimal water quality for Roanoke residents, aquatic health of the reservoir, as well as ensuring the safety of the 2000 swimmers."
activityB_scenario2,"Luckily, the reservoir was recently outfitted with a state-of-the-art water quality forecasting system. Every morning, managers receive a 16-day forecast of future algal concentrations in the reservoir, which are updated daily with the actual algal concentrations, measured in real-time using sensors in the water. Following local and national guidelines for beach closure, algal levels above 35 ug/L become costly for water treatment and detrimental to aquatic life (US EPA), and levels above YY ug/L are not suitable for human swimming."
activityB_scenario3,"As managers of Carvins Cove Reservoir, you and your partner must decide how to manage the water quality in Carvins Cove Reservoir every day over a 16-day period, using the forecasts as a guide."
